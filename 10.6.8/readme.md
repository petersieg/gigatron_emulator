### Compiled gtemu + libsdl2 for Mac OSX 10.6.8 Snow Leopard

GCC 4.2 from githu: https://github.com/not-kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer

Mac ports libsdl2 install.

Or download from here hopefully works as well. The libsdl2 need to be put into lib search path.

otool -L <exe> shows found/required libs.
